- webvr example? https://threejs.org/examples/?q=webvr#webvr_daydream
	- this is also in above ...
	- doesn't work on ios

- paths forward
	- just do google chrome
	- try to debug chrome exp. then debug composer, or ignore warning
	- try a-frame
	- try mdn

- fixed warning - was in stereoeffect.js
- wagner doesn't appear to support outside of its own effects
- try composer again, then a-frame
	- trying this solution: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/8146
